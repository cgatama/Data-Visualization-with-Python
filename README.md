# Data Visualization with Python

One of the most important skills of successful data scientists and data analysts is the ability to tell a compelling story by visualizing data and findings in an approachable and stimulating way to effectively visualize both small and large-scale data. Take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that conveys insights. 

This module introduces many Data Visualization tools and techniques to create various types of basic and advanced graphs and charts like: Waffle Charts, Area Plots, Histograms, Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Scatter Plots, Word Clouds, Choropleth Maps, and many more! You will also create interactive dashboards that allow even those without any Data Science experience to better understand data, and make more effective and informed decisions.   

We'll use several data visualization libraries in Python, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly & Dash.
